# An Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is a crucial step in the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design process. A wireframe is a two-dimensional, skeletal outline of a webpage or app. It focuses on the allocation of space, the prioritization of content, functionality, and user flow, intentionally stripping away all visual design elements like colors and fonts.
### Why Wireframing

Its primary purpose is to establish the basic structure of a page before the visual design and content are added. ✏️

## Key Elements of a Wireframe

Every wireframe, regardless of its complexity, is built from a few key elements that define the user experience.

* **Layout Structure**: This is the backbone of the wireframe. It defines how the visual elements are arranged on the page. For example, a wireframe will show where the header, footer, sidebar, and main content area are located. This ensures a logical and organized presentation of information.
* **Navigation**: This element shows how users will move through the application or website. It includes the placement of menus, buttons, and links. A clear navigation scheme in a wireframe helps ensure that users can find what they are looking for intuitively.
* **Content Placement**: Wireframes use placeholders (like simple boxes and "lorem ipsum" text) to indicate where text, images, and other media will go. This helps stakeholders visualize the information hierarchy and ensures that the most important content is given prominence.
* **Functionality**: This represents how the interactive elements of the page will work. For example, a wireframe will show what happens when a user clicks a button, uses a search bar, or interacts with a dropdown menu. It maps out the user's journey and system responses without getting into detailed coding.
